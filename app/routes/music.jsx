              So since moving over to working with websites as a full time job I
              have been reinvigorated with music and can be found most nights
              playing for a couple of hours.
            </p>
            <p className="p-2">
              I have a number of instruments but there is one in particular
              which is so easy to pick up and play I feel that I should mention
              it first.
            </p>
            <p className="p-2">
              She is a little parlor size Gretsch Jim Dandy. I originally wanted
              it in a lovely electric blue but they didn't have one on the day
              so I ended up with the one you can see just over in the other
              column.

              Perhaps I will introduce some more guitars here over time

              So I am finding that I have quite a lot of musical ideas at the
              moment and because I get bored quickly I have just been playing
              them on the guitar and not being able to layer any tracks together
              because me mac had storage space issues.
            </p>
            <p className="p-2">
              However, after sharing this problem with some friends and a trip
              to the unit I found an even older macintosh that I brought home in
              the off chance that it would load up and recognise my audio
              interface - bought at a similar time to the Gretsch.
            </p>
            <p className="p-2">
              As it happened, one good thing after another, the mac decided it
              could load up and more than that already had a DAW install and
              recognised the new audio interface.
            </p>
            <p className="p-2">
              Really now I am all out of excuses for making music accept the
              final one.... I need a new guitar lead!
